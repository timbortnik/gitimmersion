This is a work done in gitimmersion tutorial.

For some strange reason, Sam believes my memories fade at the rate when I should need to re-learn git every year :)
This way, we will end up doing basic math on a yearly basis. So, this is a little bit of cheating - yes, some commits to fool the grader.

Of course, this readme should be hidden deep inside git to never show up again. So, looks like I will have to revert master branch back to the point where all this shame will be not on the surface.
